# Ruby Messenger Platform Sample

This is a sample project showcasing the Facebook Messenger Platform, written in Ruby.

It is patterned after the Node.js sample published by Facebook [here](https://github.com/fbsamples/messenger-platform-samples), using Sinatra in place of Node Express as the Web application framework.

To use this sample, you will have to roughly follow the [Facebook Messenger Platform walkthrough](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart). The easiest way to deploy this app is on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
